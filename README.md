## Assignment 1: Concrete Class, Abstract Class, and Interface
Explanation:
1.	Main Class: Creates an object of Flagship, calls methods to demonstrate functionality.
2.	Phone Interface: Declares methods start() and stop(), which must be implemented by any class that uses this interface.
3.	Smartphone Abstract Class: Implements Phone, providing definitions for start() and stop().\
    •	Declares an abstract method chargeType() that must be implemented by subclasses.
4.	Flagship Concrete Class:\
    •	Extends Smartphone and implements the chargeType() method.\
    •	Adds a method showDetails() to display smartphone information.

This code properly demonstrates interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete classes in Java OOP.
